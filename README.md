# tic-tac-toe
Tic Tac Toe game made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and JQuery

I wanted a chance to practice using JQuery selectors and play around with the DOM. 
The win condition logic came from simplifying the game board into an array of 9 numbers. 
I mapped the array with Xs and Os as the user click on the numbered square.
I then chekced everytime the array is updated to see if it matches any of the 8 winning conditions.
The conditions were 3 horizontal, 3 vertical and 2 diaganal wins.
